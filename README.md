# Safe Links Decoder (Chrome extension)

A simple Chrome extension that displays all Microsoft
[Safe Links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/atp-safe-links?view=o365-worldwide)
on a web page as the original URLs with one click on the extension's icon, making the page easier
on the eyes.

However, this extension will not modify the addresses to which Safe Links point, and thus not
introduce any security risks. It will only change the appearance of Safe Links if they are not
shown as the original URLs (e.g., when an email embedding Safe Links is sent in plain text mode).
